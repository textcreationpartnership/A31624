         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or Proprietors that raiſe this Fund, are to be a Corporation, with perpetual Succeſſion, and all neceſſary Powers, for managing and carrying on ſuch National Trade or Trades as they ſhall agree upon.

They are more ſure than any Bills, Bonds, or Morgages, or any manner of Credit now known in the World: They have a real ſolid extrinſick and permanent Value inſeparably adhering to them by Law: Nor can their value be impaired or their Uſe taken away, by any future Parliaments, or by any Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of State, where all mens properties will not alſo be ſwallowed up. By this means a Conſiderable part of the Rents of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be applyed to Trade, which otherwiſe could not be done, Thus may all the Poor be profitably imployed: All due improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made in Husbandry, and all needful Arts and Manufacturies; The Shipping and ſtrength of the Nation will be encreaſed by Sea and Land. Publick Taxes will become eaſie to the Subjects, and all who Contribute to this Fund will be made richer by it, at their very entry into it: Beſides what their Share in the future Trade will produce,</p>
               <p>No perſon is forced to be concerned in it, yet all are permitted that ſhall deſire it; which renders it truly a free and Common-Good. Altho' at the end of 100 years, all this Credit will be called in; yet the Courſe of Trade managed with it, cannot in the mean time but produce Gold, Silver, and other Valuable Commodities, and that to a far greater Value than the Bills themſelves; And the Trade founded by them, will be perpetual. Theſe Bills not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out of the Kingdom, are an Advantage: For all wiſe Laws reſtrain Money from going out: and forraign Trade ought not to be managed with Money, but with the Native Product and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturies of the Kingdom.

               <head>Arguments to Accept <hi>Dr. Chamberlains</hi> Propoſal.</head>
               <p>THe Propoſal offers 70 years purchaſe (that is 40 down, and 30 in a joint Stock of Trade) for 100 years Annualrent: And this Bargain is to be had in poſſeſſion before any Rent payed. In the ſame ſpecie, that is payed for the Purchaſe, in the very ſame, and in no other, the Annualrent is to be paid; ſo that here is nothing given, but what will be received back. And if any man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by Law, to receive a debt or Payment in this ſpecie, another is by the ſame Law, bound to receive it from him again: and ſo from hand to hand, till it ends at laſt in the Annualrent which the Land is obliged to pay; and there it ceaſeth. Would it do <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a ſervice to bring ſome Millions of Gold and Silver into it? this is Equivalent. For ſince Credit, upon a leſs ſecure Fund, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms in other Countries, all the uſes and Offices of Gold and Silver; what ſhould hinder the ſame Effects here, upon a better Fund? But however, if an Act of Parliament paſs <hi>de bene eſſe:</hi> the Nation runs no Riſque, if it do not take: If it does take there is a Mine of Treaſure opened to them, <hi>gratis.</hi> The paſſing the Act, compelis no man to come in and engage his Land. The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, if deſired, will be obliged to cauſe bring in 100000 <hi>lib.</hi> ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or more, and purchaſe Lands in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and give 30 years Purchaſe for them, the Act being Paſſed; and then engage the Lands ſo purchaſed, in the Deſign. The Propoſal is not ſo very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, or Myſterious, to ſuch as will take the pains to read it two or three times over deliberately and attentively, and will then hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to what Anſwers can be given to any ſeeming Difficulty. The manner of putting it into practice, and actual adminiſtration of it, will indeed require an uncommon Skill and Underſtanding: and this part, Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> whoſe invention and contrivance this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is, and who has been thirty years maturing it, can beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, ſo as to reduce all to ſuch an exact method, as ſhall make the whole clear and facile, and prevent all confuſion and diſorder: which ſhould they happen, might diſgrace and ruine the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: but to ſettle this point, and concert the matter of Trade, for the greateſt benefit of this Kingdom; the Dr. in caſe the Act paſs, will come to <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> Makes a like Settlement of Lands to <hi>C.</hi> to pay a hundred <hi>lib.</hi> in Gold. for the ſame term of years; having received his Purchaſe Money in Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Pays a Debt of a hundred <hi>lib.</hi> in this Credit, to his Coach-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; the Coach-maker pays it to the Currier for Leather; the Currier pays the ſame to the Tanner for Hides: the Tanner pays the ſame to the Butcher for Skins and raw Hides: the Butcher pays it to a Graſier for Cattle: the Graſier to a Farmer for Corn and Graſs: the Farmer pays it to <hi>A.</hi> his Land-lord: and <hi>A.</hi> pays it to the Office for his Annualrent. Now here is all their occaſions anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and none the worſe, or the poorer by it; but the contrary: the Office receiving back what it delivered out.</p>
               <p>Now take the Payments as running in Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> pays a Debt in Gold of a hundred pound, to his Coach-maker: the Coach-maker pays the ſame to a Currier for Leather: the Currier pays it to a Tanner for Hides: the Tanner to a Butcher for Skins and raw Hides: the Butcher to a Graſier for Cattle: the Graſier pays it to a Farmer for Corn and Graſs: the Farmer pays it to <hi>B.</hi> his Landlord for Rent: and the Landlord pays the ſame Gold to <hi>C.</hi> for his Annualrent. Now by this Compariſon it is plain, that in the Circulation and courſe of Dealing, from the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Landlord, and back to the Office again, the turn is as well ſerved as in the inſtance of Gold. And the Office is no poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in receiving back the Credit: Nor <hi>C.</hi> no richer in receiving Back his Gold; than both were, at the iſſuing of their ſeveral Sums in Credit and Gold.</p>

                  <p>Suppoſe the Perſon Receiver of the four thouſand Pound being in Debt, ſhall pay his Debt with the ſaid four thouſand Pound, or a great part of it; ſo that his Creditor ſhall be forced to receive his Sum in his ſaid Tallies.</p>
                  <p>It is queſtioned, What uſe the ſaid Creditor who lived upon the Intereſt of his Money, can make of his Stock; ſeing in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity there would be no Borrowers upon Annualrent: For it is to

                  <p>There will be ſuch a conſiderable Stock made up of the ſeveral three Thouſand Pounds employed in Trade, that ſuch Creditors not being able, as it ſeems, to be of the Corporation propoſed, with the Landed-Men; cannot propoſe to themſelves to employ their Stock in Trading with any reaſonable Proſpect of Advantage.</p>

            <div type="answer">
               <head>ABSTRACT of, and ANSWER to, the firſt and third OBJECTIONS.</head>
               <p>FOr theſe two differ not in ſubſtance. The ſcope of them is, That all the Debts upon Land being paid by this Propoſal; and all the Subject of Trade wholly taken up by it: What ſhall become of thoſe who ſubſiſt only upon the Intereſt of their Mony? For there will be no Land to purchaſe, at leaſt for ſome years; nor none to borrow at Intereſt: And Trade, either is not underſtood by ſuch Perſons; or there is not room to receive them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Would this <hi>Objection</hi> be raiſed, if theſe Debts were paid, and ſuch a Trade Driven by Money of Gold and Silver? If it were then raiſed, it muſt needs be thought groundleſs: unleſs it be a Crime to pay Debts; and drive a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Trade, without the excluſion of any private Perſon. If it would then be thought groundleſs; there is equal reaſon it ſhould be thought ſo in this caſe. For this Credit is equal in all reſpects, and Superior in many, to coyned Gold and Silver, which is after made appear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this <hi>Propoſal</hi> be a publick and National Good, the private intereſt of ſome few particular Perſons, ought to give way to it: which has ever been the Rule of all wiſe Governments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The payment of all Debts upon Land will be greatly to the honour and advantage of the Nation: and will preſerve the Eſtates &amp; Honours of the ancient Nobility &amp; Gentry and will alſo of natural Conſequence drive into Trade, which is the Nations Strength and Riches, the greater part of that Money that now preys upon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and nobleſt parts of the Kingdom by devouring Uſury, which is the known deſtruction of untrading Perſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is denyed, that the whole Subject of Trade in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, can be exhauſted by the intended Stock, ſo as that any can want Imployment for their Money: For no Nation ever was known to be too Rich: And the Uſes and Occaſions of Money do always naturally multiply faſter than Money it ſelf. <hi>Scotland</hi> has many profitable and improveable Subjects of Trade: and had ſhe Money to give Life to Ingenuity and Induſtry, the Productions of Nature, and improvement of Art, might in few years be many hundred times improved.</p>
               <p>The Sea alone is an inexhauſtible Treaſure, and can imploy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Millions. <hi>Holland,</hi> who has no Subject of Trade; nor can have any; yet by vaſt Wealth in Coin and Credit, Drives the greateſt Trade of the World, and grows Rich by the product of other Countries; And by making her ſelf the general Store-houſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the World; and the Carrier alſo of the Goods of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to and fro, wherever ſhe is permitted.</p>
               <p>In what place ſoever there is great plenty of a Common Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Medium of Trade, which we uſually terme Money, it is impoſſible in ſhould ly Dead, Uſeleſs, or ſtagnate: For like ſtreams of Water, wherever they break out, they will by natural and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Reaſon force their own way into the wide Sea of Trade.</p>

The difference this Propoſol will make, will be thus, That now Money is for the moſt part let to Intereſt, to the ruine of thoſe that pay it; being a dead weight upon their Eſtates. But in our Caſe, the induſtrious Merchant only will take up Money at Uſe; who will at the ſame time enrich himſelf, and ſerve the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor; by which alſo the Nation it ſelf is improved.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But further, two thirds of each Landed-Mans Stock in Trade may be made allienable at pleaſure; In order to the taking in of Moneyed-men, and thereby diffuſing the Benefits of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to the greater number of Perſons, to the end it may become the more National.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Alſo, it may be enacted, that every Creditor upon Land, ſhall have Right to the value of half his Debt upon the Land it ſelf, as if he were Proprietor for ſo much; but the other half he to accept in Credit; with which he may alſo purchaſe Shares in the Trade of ſuch as are deſirous to ſell. And thus may ſuch perſons be profitably concerned in Trade, tho unskilled therein; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt fear, as I have ſhewed before, of want of Room to receive them.</p>

But if there ſhould be any found ſo idle or unhappy, after the Springs of Trade thus ſtrongly fixed, as to know no better way to imploy their Money, thus taken in Credit, than at Intereſt; Let them put it into the Bank upon theſe Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> To have 4 <hi>per cent</hi> Intereſt: And if they call out their Money, which not to be till after two years certain, and then giving ſix Months Notice; they ſhall accept it in this Credit: But if the Bank put it upon them, then to be paid in Gold and Silver; and the Bank to give alſo ſix Months notice to the Creditors.</p>

               <head>Abſtract of, and Anſwer, to the ſecond Objection.</head>
               <p>THe Objection ſuppoſes that all the Natural and Artificial Product of <hi>Scotland,</hi> exceeds not yearly one Million. And therefore, if two Millions be Coined; one muſt be idle and the Poſſeſſor of it muſt Starve. For the Money is only paſſable in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and all Goods there, are bought up with the firſt Million. And ſince no other Nation will give Goods for the Tallies, there will be no uſe for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Granting that all the preſent product of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Natural and Artificial does not exceed a Million; yet I deny the Inferrence, that if one other Million, or ten other Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be coined, they muſt be idle, and the poſſeſſor ſtarve. Let <hi>Scotland</hi> be deprived of all her preſent Money, and her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent product will inſtantly abate; and in few years come to nothing. Increaſe her Money and her product will be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. Who knows how far the Natural Product of this Kingdom may extend when there is Money, that <hi>cauſae ſine qua non,</hi> to improve things to their higheſt Perfection. Many Grounds ly now waſte for want of Stock to imploy them: And the Nerves of Induſtry are every where ſlackned, by the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of this precious Material, that gives Life and Motion to every political Body. Money, or what anſwers it, is the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of Kingdoms and States: Withdraw that Food, and they inſtantly languiſh: Supply it plentifully, and they become full of Health and Vigour. Lands and Hands are the Material and efficient Cauſes of Wealth: <hi>Scotland</hi> has enough of both to raiſe her to a flouriſhing condition, if Money were added to enable her hands, and cultivate her Lands. Add to this the Improvement of ſo many Arts and Manufactories, as never fail to offer themſelves where there is plenty of Money; And theſe in Conjunction with your Natural product, muſt be perpetual Springs of Wealth. What does <hi>Holland</hi> perform, without any Natural product, only by her Manufactories and Artificial Products. Gold and Silver can only come to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by means of an enlarged and extended Trade: Trade can be only enlarged and extended by a mighty increaſe and Perfection of Natural and Artificial product: And thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, as in all other places, ſo here alſo, can only be obtained by great plenty of Money: Which plenty this <hi>Propoſal</hi> unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyably offers. Your Product in great plenty, in great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and at moderate Price will command a Trade: And all thoſe Advantages are the neceſſary Effects of a vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Money, which will naturally make its own way to Trade. That Money, becauſe of its plenty, can lie idle, and its Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſtarve, is a Poſition till now unheard of. All Experience is againſt it: For I deny that any one inſtance can be given, where part of a Nation ſtarved, becauſe the whole was rich. It has as little Foundation in Reaſon as in Experience. For what Cauſe can be aſſigned, why Plenty ſhould occaſion Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty? Miſuſe of Plenty may do it: But then the miſapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not the Plenty is in fault. But thoſe Miſapplications are only perſonal Follies; they are nat chargeable upon Nations with regard to Trade.</p>
               <p>That our propoſed Credit, or Land-money, is only paſſable in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is an Excellency it poſſeſſes ſuperior to Money of Gold and Silver. The Laws made by all Nations to reſtrain the Export of Money, are a plain Demonſtration that it ought to be kept at Home. And this Benefit is Eſſential to this Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, it is in its own Nature Local, and needs not the reſtraint of Laws.</p>
               <p>That any can want Employment for this Money, or ſtarve in the Poſſeſſion of it, I think I have ſufficiently evinced to be impoſſible. Which yet may further appear by Paragraph the fourth of the Anſwer to the firſt and third Objections.</p>

               <p>THe great Medium of Trade and Commerce, ſuppoſed meant by the Propoſal, being to be a kind of Coin, which is to derive its value from an Act of Parliament, and of which the Pieces being to paſs for ſo great a value (as ſome of them for 100, ſome for 50, and the leaſt for 5 <hi>lib.</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) may be a great temptation for ill Men to bend their wits, and hazard their Lives, to counterfeit the ſame. <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> How the Nation ſhall be ſecured againſt an Evil of ſo dauge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a conſequence?</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Propoſal deſigning ſeveral Millions Sterling, which this Coin is to paſs for, and which cannot be uſeful to the Nation, and owners thereof, unleſs thereby an univerſal Trade through all the World be carried on by them; which cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an additional Stock in real Species of Gold and Silver, to ſerve in Exchange for the Minute uſes of the Nation, whilſt this Coin is to have courſe: And alſo requires Trafficking Merchants. who are acquainted and experienced in a Trade of ſo vaſt an extent, for carrying it on. <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> How the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be ſecured of this additional Stock, (of an hundred thouſand Pounds Sterling, or more) which the maker of the Propoſal offers; and that ſuch Merchants ſhall take up their Reſidence here, and carry on the Trade propoſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thoſe of this Nation in it.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There being little or no uſe of Annual-rent, if the <hi>Propoſal</hi> take effect, thoſe who have Money, and are not acquainted with Trade, will be obliged to carry their Money out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that they may have Annualrent for it elſe where. <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur,</hi> How the Nation ſhall be ſecured againſt the draining, this way, of the Gold and Silver that ſhall be in the Kingdom, out of it, and nothing left but this Statutory Coin?</p>

And if the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, propoſed to be made, ſhould happen to be thereafter Reſcinded; the Creditors (who ſhould have nothing but this Statutory Coin at that time in their hands) ſhould come to be ruined.</p>

               <p n="7">VII. If Money ſhall be multiplyed at the rate of the Propoſal, all Commodities will riſe in their prices, and Workmen will exact greater Wages, And it is not to be ſuppoſed, that people getting their payment in Statutory Coin, will take the ſame price as if they were getting payment in Gold or Silver. And the Advantage that the Maſters of Manufactories have, in this Nation, above thoſe in <hi>England</hi> is, that the Wages of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Scotland</hi> is much leſs than of thoſe in <hi>England.

               <p>MOney is a Common and Secure Pledge, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to ſupply the Defects of Barter: and to be the Meaſure, Medium, and Account of Trade.</p>
               <p>What ever can anſwer thoſe ends, is duely Qualified to be made Money, by the Laws of any Nation.</p>
               <p>Money muſt have theſe Eſſential Qualities, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Value: to make it a Security in Exchange for all ſorts of Goods.</item>
                     <item>2. Different Values, for convenience of ſmaller and greater Payments.</item>
                     <item>3. Stamp of the Government: not to give, but to atteſt its Value, and to Authorize the Currency of it.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Tallies, Bills of Credit, or Land-money, propoſed by Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> will have all theſe qualities of Money, equally with Money of Gold and Silver in all reſpects, and ſuperior in ſome.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to Value: Money of Gold and Silver, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not its Value by Weight, at the moſt: and is very often ſhort of it; either by too great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in Coynage; or by Waſhing, Filing, or Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Whereas every Bill of this Credit will be ſecured by Land of greater worth than it is Coyned for: and is not ſubject to any Allay in Coynage; nor to have its value diminiſhed by any ſort of frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent Arts whatever.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> As to different Values: that will be ſettled as ſhall be judged moſt Efficacious for the ends of Trade.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Stamp of the Government. <hi>4thly.</hi> Durabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>5thly.</hi> Portability, are equally provided for as in Gold and Silver: indeed more, as to Porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: for 100 pound in Credit, will ſcarce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed an Ounce of Silver, in Weight or Bulk.</p>
               <p>Money is not ſo convenient, as this Credit, in theſe reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> For daily uſe in large Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the trouble and Loſs of time in Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Retelling; the Danger of Clipt and Counterfeit Money; the trouble of carrying great Sums from Houſe to Houſe; its being ſubject to be Tranſported to other Nations; and to be hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Miſers, who fondly doat upon the Metalls.</p>
               <p>Money is only a ſecure Pledge, of a known Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, that a man ſhall be repayd in ſome other Commodity, for the Commodity he parts withal: and it ſerves but to ſupply the Interval of time, between the ſelling of one Commodity, and the buying of another.</p>
               <p>Now the propoſed Tallies can well ſupply that Interval, and are yet a more ſecure Pledge than Money of Gold and Silver: For ten thouſand Pounds in Money of Gold and Silver, is of no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter value than what it pretends; and is very often of a leſs value. But ten thouſand Pounds in this Credit will be ſecured by 22500 pounds in Land: For to ſo much amounts 150 pound <hi>per annum,</hi> the payment thereof for 100 years, being ſecured by 150 years, tho to be void upon 100 Annual Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:31501:5"/>
               <p>The Difference between the true value of Land, and Money, is evident, in that Money is willingly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Land; but Land is not turned into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but through Neceſſity and Conſtraint. All men allow Land a ſufficient, and the beſt Security for Money: what Secures muſt then be more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible than what is ſecured.</p>

               <head>ANSWER to the Eight <hi>Objections</hi> given in to the Committee, upon the 4th. of <hi>July 1693.</hi>

               <p>To the <hi>Firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe Medium of Trade propoſed by Dr. <hi>Chamberlen,</hi> is a Species of Money, or Bills of Credit, not deriving any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue from an Act of Parliament, but having the Authority of a Law to Atteſt, that they have a real Value inſeparably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, and adhering to them; and ſecured by a Fund of Land of greater intrinſick Value than ſo much Gold or Silver, as the Credit is to paſs for. And that this will, <hi>de facto,</hi> be the Caſe, the Compariſon of Money and Credit, this day alſo given into the Committee, plainly makes out. As to the preventing For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and Counterfeits; I grant the Propoſal to be worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing if there be not an effectual Proviſion againſt them. But the Method of that, and Management of the whole, without Diſorder, are Secrets that the Doctor, in Prudence, reſerves to himſelf, until the Nation have Secured to him the Reward of his Service, according to his Printed <hi>Propoſal</hi> given in to the Parliament the 14th of <hi>June</hi> laſt.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Second.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AN Univerſal Trade, and through all the World, are very large and Extenſive Terms: and a far leſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs will take up ten times a greater Sum than is meant by the Propoſal. I confeſs that Gold and Silver will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſeful to ſerve the Minute Neceſſitys of Trade; and thoſe Neceſſities will occaſion a double Benefit: They will both preſerve the preſent Money within the Kingdom: and cauſe Returns of more, as the Ballance of Trade. But if in the mean time, 100000 <hi>lib.</hi> be deſired, Security ſhall be given to have it brought into the Kingdom upon very reaſonable Terms; in caſe the Propoſal be Eſtabliſhed by Law, to the Satisfaction of Dr. <hi>Chamberlen.</hi> The Doctor will alſo cauſe preſent the Nation with ſuch a Scheme of Trade; aſſiſted with ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent underſtanding and expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </p>
               <p>THere will be no neceſſity for any Man to carry his Money to be put to Intereſt out of the Kingdom, in caſe this Propoſal take effect: For it is before plainly ſhewed how Moneyed men may more profitably employ their Money at home. The Laws of the Kingdom againſt Exporting Money being reinforced; between the fear of them and the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Keeping their Money at home, the Nation will be in no danger of being drained of their Gold and Silver. Beſides, the great increaſe of Trade, which muſt be the neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of this Propoſal, will occaſion a mighty encreaſe of Gold and Silver in a very few years.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Fourth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THis Objection ſeems to fear, that the Nobility and Gentry having paid their Debts by this means, the Act may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards come to be reſcinded, to the Ruine of their Creditors. But the Honour, Juſtice, and Intereſt of the whole Nation will ſufficiently ſecure all men; from the fear that a Law made to this end can ever be reſcinded by any Deſign or Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Nobility and Gentry. For, were they capable of ſo unjuſt and ungenerous Thoughts, what need they go ſo far about; and do at twice what may be done at once? One ſingle Act of Parliament to diſcharge all their Debts will do the whole Work at a Blow. But further, the reſcinding ſuch a Law will be utterly impoſſible; for the Credit is founded upon Securities made by private perſons, for valuable Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in vertue of a Law for the Eſtabliſhing a National Trade. As well may it be feared, that an Act ſhould paſs to Suppreſs the preſent Money, and leave it uſeleſs: or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive any number of men of their Legal Inheritance. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, The reſcinding this Law would be for the Nation to Rob it ſelf: for the Credit being Current in all payments would preſently diffuſe it ſelf through the whole Body of the people: and the Nobility and Gentry would always be well furniſhed with it, by Rent from their Tennants: beſides the very great loſs they would ſuſtain by being deprived of their ſhares in the National Trade, which as ſounded upon the Credit, muſt immediatly ſink with it. When this is well conſidered, there can be no imagination ſo ſickly to entertain ſo wild and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible a Dream. And yet if the Parliament think fit (tho' I am ſure there can be no need) they may inſert a Clauſe, that in caſe ſuch Act ſhould be reſcinded, each Creditor and Debtor ſhall ſtand in the ſame terms and relation to each other, with regard to their Debts and Credits, and the Legal Obligations to Payment, and Remedies for Recovery, as at the time of making ſuch Act.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The advantage of this Propoſal is not ſo limited to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Man, but that mediatly, or immediatly its influence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit muſt be extended through the whole Nation in general. and more or leſs to every individual. It is a miſtake to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that either Merchants or Moneyed men will be prejudiced. It is already ſhewed, how money'd men may ſufficiently find their Account. As to the Merchants; is it reaſonable for them to oppoſe the Flouriſhing of their Country, by a large and National Trade; in favour of their preſent little Dealings, that deſerve not the name of Commerce? It ought to ſuffice the Merchants, that not one of them ſhall be excluded from dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving whatever Trade he thinks fit. And ſuch of them as have Land or money, may come in and be actual Sharers: and ſuch others, whoſe ſkill and fitneſs ſhall recommend them, will no doubt be employed as the Managers of this National Trade; where they may gain without hazard: For the Nobility and Gentry, whoſe Education fits them more for State and Military Employments, than for Commerce, will unqueſtionably call in the Aſſiſtance of the Skilful Merchants. If 1000 Forreign Merchants, with each 10000 <hi>lib.</hi> Stock, ſhould Petition the Parliament for leave to reſide in this Kingdom, and to follow Merchandize here; is it probable the Government would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to receive them, becauſe the Merchants of little ſtocks ſhould oppoſe it? The publick Intereſt is firſt to be ſought; and no little ends are to be brought in Competition with the proſperity of a Nation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is not true that this <hi>Propoſal</hi> was ever Rejected by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament. But if it had; it is not the firſt time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have miſtaken their Intereſt. They mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

For as money multiplies, ſo do the Uſes and Occaſins for it, and Arts and Manufactures in proportion. No wiſe man throws away his money, or pays too dear, becauſe he is rich.
